    <!-- SETUP
      1.) Add the external data.js to the head
        * Take some time to review and look it over
        * How would you check to see that it was properly loaded?

      2.) Add the app.js file at the end of the body
        * Why do we do that?
        * How would you check to see that it is properly linked?

      3.) Create a CSS file for your index html
        * Verify it is linked properly

    <!-- Map practice

      Part A.)

      1.) Map over the data warnings
        * For each warning return the type wrapped in <div> and </div>

      2.) Set the innerHTML of #warnings to the mapped warnings types above


      Part B.)

      2.) For each warning display the the warnings type and message in the div
        * Put the type in h2 tags and the message in paragraph tags.

      Part Ahy

      1.) When someone types in the "#foodCategories" input field console log the value
        * Try using the "change" event
        * Try using the "keydown" event
        * Try using the "keypress" event

      2.) Filter through the values in the data categories to find
            values starting with the value in #foodCategories
        * Console log the values similar to the one in the input field
        * Map each of the similar values to values wrapped in <option>
          and </option> tags
        * Set the mapped similar options to the innerHTML of the #suggestions element

      3.) Add the class hidden to the #suggestions element
        * After setting the innerHTML of the suggestions remove the hidden class
          from the classList

      Part Bee

      3.) Listen for the change event on the suggestions
        * When clicked log the #suggestions value

      4.) Set the value of the #foodCategories to the selected suggestion
        * Add back the hidden class to the #suggestions element

      Part C

      5.) When the #filtering form submits
        * Prevent the default form event behavior
          * What does that do?
        * Console log the foodCategories value

      6.) Filter the warnings to only warning matching the foodCategories values
        * Log the warnings of that type
        * Set the warnings and their messages and types to the innerHTML of #warnings

      7.) Display the items of the selected #foodCategories on submit
        * Display on the names of the items
        * Display the description of the item
        * Wrap the description in a div and the name in an h2 tag
          * Add a class name of description to all items
          * Make all descriptions hidden by default
          * Display all descriptions on hover
            * Should you use JS or CSS for this? Why?
            * You should definitely use CSS.
